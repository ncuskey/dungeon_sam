# Phase 1 Verification

## Must-Haves
- [x] Grid-based movement controller — VERIFIED (Browser tests confirm arrow key movement)
- [x] Doom-style billboard rendering shader/component — VERIFIED (Billboard component implemented, sprites face camera)
- [x] Basic level rendering — VERIFIED (Walls/Floor render from map array)

## Verdict: PASS
Phase 1 goals met. A solid engine foundation is established.
