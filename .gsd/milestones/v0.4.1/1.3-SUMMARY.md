# Plan 1.3 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Level Renderer Component (Walls, Floor, Ceiling based on map)
- [x] Billboard Sprite Component (Face-camera logic)

## Verification
- **Visual**: Screenshots `level_render.png` and `billboard_visible.png` confirm:
    - Walls are rendered at correct grid positions.
    - Floor and ceiling planes are present.
    - Green billboard sprite is visible and faces the camera.

## Learnings
- simple `lookAt(camera.position)` is sufficient for spherical billboard behavior (Doom style).
