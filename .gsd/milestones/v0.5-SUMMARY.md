# Milestone: v0.5 "Goblins & Torches"

## Completed: 2026-02-18

## Deliverables
- ✅ **New Goblin enemy type**: 60 HP, 8 Damage, Fast movement.
- ✅ **Shield item**: 50% passive damage reduction, HUD integration.
- ✅ **Multi-perspective Wall Torches**: Front/Left/Right rendering based on player view.
- ✅ **Visual update for doors**: Parallel orientation, passable physics.

## Phases Completed
1. Phase 1: Asset Foundation — 2026-02-18
2. Phase 2: The Goblin Horde — 2026-02-18
3. Phase 3: Shield & Defense — 2026-02-18
4. Phase 4: Environmental Overhaul — 2026-02-18
5. Phase 5: Verification & Launch — 2026-02-18

## Metrics
- **Total commits**: 24
- **Files changed**: 54
- **Duration**: ~3 days

## Lessons Learned
- **Coordinate Systems matter**: Door and Torch orientation regressions highlight the need for a standardized prop-mounting helper in subsequent milestones.
- **Perspective Selection**: 3D dot product logic (`camera.getWorldDirection()`) is superior to position-based proximity (`cameraToTorch`) for billboard perspective switching.
- **Asset Fit**: Small assets like "Door Fit.png" require exact cell-size matching to prevent Z-fighting or visual gaps.

## Technical Victories
- **Optimized Sprites**: Used NearestFilter and transparency management to preserve retro feel.
- **BSP Integration**: Procedural doors correctly placed at BSP partition boundaries.
- **Sound Feedback**: Improved UX by adding error sounds for full inventory.
