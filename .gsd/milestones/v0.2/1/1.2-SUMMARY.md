# Plan 1.2 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Grid State & Input Store (`useGameStore` with Zustand)
- [x] Player Controller Component (Keyboard input mapping)
- [x] Smooth Camera Rig (Camera follows player state with lerp)

## Verification
- **Movement**: Verified via browser interaction. ArrowUp moves player, ArrowLeft/Right turns.
- **Visual**: Camera moves smoothly to new grid cells.
- **Collision**: Logic exists in `gameStore` (checked against `INITIAL_MAP`).

## Learnings
- R3F `Canvas` context separation requires `PlayerController` to be either inside or outside depending on needs. Placed outside in `App` for cleaner input handling.
