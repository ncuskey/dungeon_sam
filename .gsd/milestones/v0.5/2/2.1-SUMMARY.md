# Plan 2.1 Summary: The Goblin Horde

## Objective Complete
Implement speed and health variations for enemies and introduce the Goblin enemy type into the dungeon generation.

## Changes Made
- **Enemy Movement Cooldown**: Introducted `moveCooldown` to `Enemy` interface.
- **AI Logic**: Updated `tickGame` to handle cooldowns (Goblins move every 400ms, Imps every 800ms).
- **Type-Based Damage**: Goblins deal 8 damage, Imps deal 5 damage.
- **Randomized Spawning**: `generateDungeon` now spawns 40% Goblins with 60 HP.

## Verification
- Succesful build with `npm run build`.
- Code logic verified for movement rate and damage scaling.
