# Plan 4.1 Summary: Directional Torches

## Objective Complete
Finalize directional logic for wall-mounted torches using multi-perspective assets.

## Changes Made
- **Data Model**: Added `facing` property to `Light` interface.
- **Generation**: Updated `generateLights` to store the attachment wall orientation (N/S/E/W).
- **Rendering**: Updated `LevelRenderer.tsx` and `Billboard.tsx` to select `torch_front.png`, `torch_left.png`, or `torch_right.png` based on the dot product between the camera perspective and the wall facing vector.
- **Visuals**: Enabled `NearestFilter` for torch textures to maintain pixel-art crispness.

## Verification
- Successful build with `npm run build`.
- Logic verified: Dot product > 0.5 correctly selects the front texture.
