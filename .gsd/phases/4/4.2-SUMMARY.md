# Plan 4.2 Summary: Door Integration

## Objective Complete
Implement door placement in the dungeon generator and render them in the 3D world.

## Changes Made
- **Generator**: Added a post-processing pass in `dungeonGenerator.ts` to place doors (value `2`) at narrow corridor junctions with 15% probability.
- **Rendering**: Updated `LevelRenderer.tsx` to detect cell `2` and render a slim box mesh with the `door_fit.png` texture. Doors are automatically oriented based on adjacent walls.
- **Movement**: Updated `moveForward` and `moveBackward` in `gameStore.ts` to allow the player to enter cells with value `2`.

## Verification
- Successful build with `npm run build`.
- Logic verified: Doors appear at logical transitions and are passable.
