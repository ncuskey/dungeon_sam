# Plan 3.1 Summary: Shield & Defense

## Objective Complete
Implement shield equipment logic and passive damage reduction. Update the HUD to reflect the status of the equipped shield.

## Changes Made
- **Inventory Extension**: Added `equippedShieldId` to `Inventory` and global state.
- **Auto-Equip Logic**: Picking up a 'shield' item now automatically equips it.
- **Damage Reduction**: Updated `tickGame` to reduce incoming damage by 50% if a shield is equipped.
- **HUD Update**: The HUD now displays the name of the equipped shield (e.g. "SHIELD: IRON SHIELD").

## Verification
- Successful build with `npm run build`.
- Logic verified for passive blocking and auto-equipment.
